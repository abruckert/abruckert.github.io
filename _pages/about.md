I am a postoctoral reasearcher at the [LS2N lab](https://www.ls2n.fr/), [Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/), [Polytech Nantes](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/), France. As a member of the [IPI team](https://www.ls2n.fr/equipe/ipi/?lang=en), my research interests include human perception, visual attention, computer vision and perception-driven image processing. More specifically, at the moment, I'm interested in studying personal perceptual experience in immersive environements.

I received the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and data science from Paris Saclay University, France, in 2018, and the M.Eng. degree in computer science from École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise (ENSIIE), Évry, France, in 2018. I received the Ph.D. degree from Rennes 1 University, France, in 2022. [My thesis](https://ged.univ-rennes1.fr/nuxeo/site/esupversions/45936f86-1136-478e-8404-ebaf73a90007?inline) explored the relationship between visual attention and cinematographic features from a computer vision point of view.
